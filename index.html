    <p>The Perfect Fit, a <meta itemprop="keywords" content="relationship advice, psychology, temperament, personality" />psychology-based <span itemprop="genre">self-help</span> work by Dr. Sandra K. Woods, explores and answers these questions and more. <span itemprop="about">Woods proposes the existence of two basic temperament types that are opposite and complementary in nature: one of Being, and one of Doing. She discusses the underlying dynamics, the traits common to each <span itemprop="keywords">temperament</span> type, and the attractive forces that bind the two together.</span></p>
<p>She also proposes a simple neurochemical template upon which these basic temperaments are superimposed. This study uses examples from everyday life to illustrate natural differences in the imprinting of psychic feeling, which can and does lead to natural differences in perception and communication. It describes and defines qualities common to all feelings, as related to fitting, bonding, weight, and contagion. Finally, the study considers the five stages of <span itemprop="keywords">marriage</span> in the context of these basic differences, examining common pitfalls along the way.</p>
<p>With some solid grounding in understanding the differences between these two basic temperament types, it is indeed possible to have a mutually fulfilling <span itemprop="keywords" itemprop="relationships">relationship</span>, as partners work to understand, trust, and accept each other.</p>

    <div id="reviews"><div class="review">
    <blockquote><p><span class="bqstart">&#8220</span>In <span itemprop="keywords">The Perfect Fit</span> <span itemprop="keywords">Dr. Sandra Woods</span>, based on her understanding of the <span itemprop="keywords">brain</span> and her long experience as a professional, has created an engaging presentation of the nature of human temperament. Starting with a clear and very readable exposition based on <span itemprop="keywords">neuroscience</span> and the chemistry at work in the brain, she leads us to an understanding of the spectrum of personality types from Be-ers, who literally live for the moment, to Do-ers, who carefully plan their actions with an eye on the future. Wonder why you are an impulse buyer? Or, wonder why you take forever to decide on a major purchase? This little gem of a book will help you understand who you are.<span class="bqend">&#8221</span></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="bqstart">&#8220</span>I have known Dr. Woods for several years, and have found her research into the time orientation continuum, referred to here in her second book as temperament, fascinating and insightful. This is an intriguing book. The topic of temperament is timely, and the conceptual perspective of the author is extremely unique and highly professional. I would highly recommend it to professionals and lay people alike. Couples, in particular, would greatly benefit from the simple, pragmatic approach to understanding and accepting the opposing and complementary perspective of their partner.<span class="bqend">&#8221</span></p></blockquote>
